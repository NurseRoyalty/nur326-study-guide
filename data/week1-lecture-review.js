      stem: "A 68-year-old patient with COPD presents to urgent care with fever, purulent sputum, and a cough productive of green phlegm for 3 days. Blood and sputum cultures have been ordered. The nurse reviews the culture requisition to ensure proper collection. Which statement best describes the priority action the nurse should take regarding this culture collection?",
      options: [
        "Defer drawing the cultures until the patient has fever, as temperature elevates sensitivity of the culture plate",
        "Obtain the cultures immediately before starting any antimicrobial therapy, as giving antibiotics may prevent organism identification",
        "Wait until the next morning to obtain cultures when the lab is fully staffed and can process them more efficiently",
        "Collect cultures only if the patient is hospitalized, as community-acquired infections can be presumptively treated"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      rationale: "Culture samples must be obtained BEFORE antimicrobials are started to allow proper organism growth and identification. Giving antibiotics first may suppress bacterial growth in the culture, preventing accurate identification of the pathogen. This is critical for guiding narrower, targeted therapy. The other options delay appropriate treatment or incorrectly assume timing affects culture accuracy.",

      stem: "A 45-year-old patient with a community-acquired urinary tract infection has a penicillin allergy (rash and facial swelling when given amoxicillin 5 years ago). Which medication classes must the nurse anticipate may cause a cross-reactivity concern and potentially be contraindicated in this patient? Select all that apply.",
      options: [
        "Cephalosporins",
        "Carbapenems",
        "Fluoroquinolones",
        "Sulfonamides",
        "Aminoglycosides"
      ],
      answers: [0, 1],
      rationale: "Cephalosporins and carbapenems both contain the beta-lactam ring structure similar to penicillins, creating cross-reactivity risk in penicillin-allergic patients. The patient's history of angioedema (facial swelling) indicates a true IgE-mediated allergy, not just adverse effects. Fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, and aminoglycosides have different chemical structures and do not carry significant cross-reactivity with penicillins, though sulfonamide allergy (separate from penicillin allergy) is common.",

      stem: "A patient with an upper respiratory infection caused by a virus has come to the clinic requesting antibiotics. The patient states, 'I don't feel good and just want something to help me get better faster.' The nurse is preparing to educate the patient about why antibiotics are not indicated. Which fact should the nurse include in this discussion to best explain the risk-benefit of unnecessary antibiotic use?",
      options: [
        "Antibiotics for viral upper respiratory infections work in about 4 out of 10 patients and carry a 1 in 1000 risk of serious allergic reaction or severe diarrhea",
        "Viruses are too large for antibiotics to penetrate, making the medication ineffective against viral pathogens",
        "The bacteria in the upper respiratory system are naturally resistant to all common antibiotics used for this indication",
        "Antibiotics will eliminate the normal flora that protects against secondary fungal infections" }
      ],
      answer: 0,
      rationale: "The statistics presented—1 in 4000 chance of helping, 1 in 1000 chance of harm—demonstrate the poor risk-benefit ratio of antibiotics for viral URIs. This evidence-based data point is most persuasive for patient education. Viruses do live inside host cells making it harder for antibiotics to reach them, but this is not the primary reason we don't use them. The other options don't accurately reflect the actual risk-benefit profile of antibiotic use in viral URI.",

      stem: "A 32-year-old patient with a penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus wound infection is receiving nafcillin IV. The patient asks the nurse why they cannot take this medication by mouth since other antibiotics can be taken orally. What is the primary reason nafcillin must be given intravenously?",
      options: [
        "Nafcillin is poorly absorbed from the GI tract and requires IV administration to achieve adequate blood levels",
        "Penicillinase-resistant penicillins require continuous IV infusion to maintain peak drug concentrations above the bacterial MIC",
        "Oral nafcillin would be inactivated by stomach acid before absorption, making it therapeutically ineffective",
        "The IV route allows nafcillin to bypass the normal renal filtration that would eliminate it if given orally" }
      ],
      answer: 0,
      rationale: "Nafcillin is poorly absorbed orally due to its chemical structure and metabolism in the GI tract. IV administration ensures reliable, therapeutic drug levels needed to treat aggressive staphylococcal infections. While peak-trough levels are important for some drugs, this is not why nafcillin specifically cannot be given orally. Stomach acid does not inactivate nafcillin, and renal filtration occurs regardless of route of administration.",

      id: 5,
      stem: "A 56-year-old patient admitted to the ICU with sepsis and renal dysfunction is prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam (Zoltan). The nurse caring for this patient recognizes that piperacillin-tazobactam is used for this patient because it provides broad-spectrum coverage. Which organisms is this patient most at risk for, given the reason for selecting this particular extended-spectrum penicillin? Select all that apply.",
      options: [
        "Pseudomonas aeruginosa",
        "Staphylococcus epidermidis",
        "Anaerobic gram-negative rods",
        "Streptococcus pneumoniae",
        "Enterococcus species" }
      ],
      answers: [0, 2],
      rationale: "Piperacillin-tazobactam is specifically valued for coverage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic gram-negative rods, making it ideal for critically ill patients at risk for nosocomial infections involving these organisms. While it covers some gram-positive cocci, it is not the drug of choice for S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, or Enterococcus. The renal dysfunction requires monitoring but does not change the organism coverage; however, dose adjustment will be necessary.",

      stem: "A 28-year-old patient with genital herpes simplex virus is prescribed acyclovir 400 mg orally three times daily for 10 days at the onset of symptoms. The patient asks if this will 'cure' the infection so it never comes back. How should the nurse respond to this patient's question?",
      options: [
        "Yes, acyclovir eliminates all herpes simplex virus from your body, preventing future outbreaks completely",
        "No, acyclovir decreases symptom severity and duration but does not eliminate the dormant virus from your nerve cells, so outbreaks may recur",
        "Acyclovir works by preventing new viral particles from being created, but only if started within 24 hours of symptom onset",
        "The virus will be cured if you take acyclovir for the full 10 days without missing any doses" }
      ],
      answer: 1,
      rationale: "Acyclovir works symptomatically by inhibiting viral replication during active infection, but herpes simplex virus remains dormant in nerve tissue even after successful treatment. It decreases symptom severity and viral shedding but does not eradicate the virus, making recurrent outbreaks possible. Starting within 48 hours (not 24) of symptom onset optimizes efficacy, but even perfect adherence will not 'cure' the infection because the virus persists latently.",

    },
    {
      id: 7,
      stem: "A 71-year-old patient with suspected influenza A presents 2 days after symptom onset with fever, myalgia, and cough. The patient received the influenza vaccine this year. The provider prescribes oseltamivir (Tamiflu) 75 mg orally twice daily. What is the primary mechanism by which oseltamivir provides therapeutic benefit in this patient?",
      options: [
        "Oseltamivir binds to influenza proteins on the surface of the host cell, preventing viral attachment and entry",
        "Oseltamivir inhibits neuraminidase, an enzyme that allows newly formed virus particles to be released from infected cells",
        "Oseltamivir blocks viral DNA polymerase, preventing the replication of viral genetic material in the host cell nucleus",
        "Oseltamivir enhances the host immune response by upregulating interferon production against influenza virus" }
      ],
      answer: 1,
      rationale: "Oseltamivir specifically inhibits neuraminidase, the enzyme influenza viruses use to release new viral particles from infected cells. This traps virus inside cells, limiting spread. The drug works only if started within 48 hours of symptom onset during active viral replication. The other mechanisms describe different antiviral strategies but not oseltamivir's mechanism. Note that vaccination status does not preclude antiviral use when infection occurs.",

    {
      id: 8,
      stem: "A 35-year-old patient with HIV infection and a CD4 count below 50 has just been diagnosed with CMV retinitis. The prescriber orders ganciclovir IV 5 mg/kg twice daily. Before administering this medication, the nurse must be aware of which serious adverse effect that requires close monitoring in this patient? Select all that apply.",
      options: [
        "Pancytopenia from bone marrow suppression",
        "Nephrotoxicity and need for careful renal dosing",
        "Potential fertility impairment and teratogenicity",
        "Seizures from direct CNS toxicity",
        "Hepatotoxicity requiring liver function monitoring" }
      ],
      answers: [0, 1, 2],
      rationale: "Ganciclovir carries four black-box warnings, including hematologic toxicity (pancytopenia affecting all cell lines), renal impairment requiring dose adjustment, and fertility/teratogenic effects in both males and females of childbearing age. These effects require baseline labs and close monitoring. While seizures can occur with some carbapenem antibiotics (particularly imipenem), this is not a primary ganciclovir concern. Hepatotoxicity is not a documented adverse effect of ganciclovir.",

      id: 9,
      stem: "A hospitalized patient develops a superinfection (Clostridioides difficile) after receiving IV antibiotics for a nosocomial pneumonia. Which aspect of the original antibiotic therapy most directly contributed to this adverse outcome?",
      options: [
        "Broad-spectrum antibiotics eliminated normal colonic flora that normally suppress C. difficile growth",
        "IV antibiotics accumulate in the colon more readily than oral antibiotics, creating a high-concentration environment for C. difficile proliferation",
        "Hospitalized patients receiving IV antibiotics lose their normal immune response to enteric pathogens",
        "Broad-spectrum antibiotics cause direct damage to the intestinal mucosa, promoting C. difficile adherence" }
      ],
      answer: 0,
      rationale: "Superinfection with C. difficile occurs because broad-spectrum antibiotics eliminate the normal gut flora that keep C. difficile spores suppressed through competition for resources and production of inhibitory compounds. This disruption of the normal flora creates opportunity for overgrowth of resistant organisms. The route (IV vs. oral) does not determine superinfection risk; rather, the broad spectrum and resulting disruption of normal flora is the key factor. Immune suppression and mucosa damage are not the primary mechanisms.",

      id: 10,
      stem: "A 24-year-old patient presents with a diagnosis of genital gonorrhea and has been prescribed ceftriaxone IM and azithromycin PO. This combination therapy is recommended because gonorrhea has increasingly developed resistance to fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics. Which statement best explains why combination therapy with two different antibiotic classes is preferred for this condition?",
      options: [
        "Azithromycin and ceftriaxone work synergistically to penetrate the thick gonorrheal cell wall more effectively than either drug alone",
        "Using two antibiotics simultaneously reduces the likelihood that gonorrhea will develop resistance to both agents during treatment",
        "The combination achieves higher peak serum concentrations than monotherapy, improving bacterial kill rates",
        "Ceftriaxone and azithromycin target different bacterial structures, providing both immediate and delayed bacterial death" }
      ],
      answer: 1,
      rationale: "Combination antibiotic therapy is used for gonorrhea to reduce the emergence of resistance during treatment. By using two different antibiotic classes simultaneously, if a gonorrheal cell develops resistance to one agent, the other will still kill it. This dual-targeting approach slows the development of multi-drug resistance. This is different from synergistic mechanisms (which enhance efficacy of each drug) and is primarily about preserving antibiotic effectiveness for future patients.",
